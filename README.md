# Arduino-SW-Serial-Example
This is an example of using Arduino Software Serial.
The example given at
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/SoftwareSerialExample
doesn't seem to work.
This example takes two Arduinos or similar.
I used two Metro Mini's. 
   Connect Arduino 1 pin 10 to Arduino 2 pin 11
   Connect Arduino 1 pin 11 to Arduino 2 pin 10
Load a copy of the same software on to each.
Open the serial monitor to each and watch the echo between them.

Trying other pin pairs is left as an exercise to the interested
